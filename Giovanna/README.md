> # TO DO: 
- clean data sets for premlim LR
- clean data sets for prelim NN

> ### 4/24
- ~~Find change in `ozone`, `birth weight` reporting to ensure metrics are on same scale~~
- ~~modify data given above findings~~
- NO: David has better data ~~extract distribution center list from that site~~

## 4/23??
- ~~get lat/long/city/county from zip for ES1~~
- ~~compile all 4 datasets together~~

> ### 4/22
* cleaned up ES2: extracted city, zip, lat long from one location 
* compiled all data, with zip as ID ... one doesn't have census tract, but we can easily get it with David's scripts
* re-did some EDA with cleaner data, kept David's supplementary analysis to
* ALL DATA has NO DUPLICATES, but I kept nulls - we can imput otherwise later 
* 

> ### 4/14
* duplicated David's EDA for 3.0, minus _cartopy_ - mostly the same stuff
* extracting center list from that site 

> ### 4/12 
aggregate eda

> ### 4/10
initial eda
