> # TO DO: 
- Find change in `ozone`, `birth weight` reporting to ensure metrics are on same scale
- modify data given above findings
- ~~compile all 4 datasets together~~
- NO: David has better data ~~extract distribution center list from that site~~
- ~~clean data sets for premlim LR
- clean data sets for prelim NN

> ### 4/22
* compiled all data, with zip as ID ... one doesn't have census tract, but we can easily get it with David's scripts
* re-did some EDA with cleaner data, kept David's supplementary analysis to
* ALL DATA has NO DUPLICATES, but I kept nulls - we can imput otherwise later 
* 

> ### 4/14
* duplicated David's EDA for 3.0, minus _cartopy_ - mostly the same stuff
* extracting center list from that site 

> ### 4/12 
aggregate eda

> ### 4/10
initial eda
