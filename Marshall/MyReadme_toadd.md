### Background on the data what each of the sets are, Big picture(where it came from, how we obtained it, why it is useful). Describe how it was transformed, and what were the general results. Explaination of data dictionary. 

How we encountered percentiles and values in values. initial findings with barebones models. Findings in EDA with location, industry, traffic and connection to health problems. Why its relevant now for someone analyzing this. 

Methodology for why certain models were choosen. 


## Background

#### Cal Enviroscreen
- CalEnviroScreen is a mapping tool that helps identify California communities that are most affected by many sources of pollution, and where people are often especially vulnerable to pollutionâ€™s effects.
- CalEnviroScreen uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract in the state.
- The scores are mapped so that different communities can be compared. An area with a high score is one that experiences a much higher pollution burden than areas with low scores.
- CalEnviroScreen ranks communities based on data that are available from state and federal government sources. (Source: https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/about-calenviroscreen)

## Executive Summary

It's time to prepare the California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard's for a successful auditing process on industry leading companies within the state. California is the home to many successful industry leading companies that supply on a global scale. It is crucial that no area of any company has oversight by the OEHHA and is inefficient or unorganized as to ensure no health hazards are unrecognized for the public. Our aim is to capitalize on the meticulous data gathered in the yearly Enviro-Screen report and be prepared to answer confidently and questions about pollution production and correation with public health. When it comes to the health of our citizens there is no room for error.

We are a team of data scientist's that specialize in exactly that and have found atleast 5 points of interest so that the OEHHA will be able to accurately label and have predictive strength to monitor adverse health effects caused by pollution in industry and beyond. First-hand, there are insightful correlations (both negative and positive) between asthma, cardiovascular disease, Diesel particulates, and Ozone(add more here*). Secondly, I have a plan of action for how to increase citizen awareness and highlight specific area prone to health complication factors from pollution. These two factors in conjunction will pave the way for predictive/preventitive techniques so that California remains the Golden State for future generations. 

Through our Regression modeling techniques, the team can determine a statistically correct predictive algorithm that can Identify future and current 'hot spots' of heavy pollution and how they impact the population. With millions of industry dense areas 

there is significant overlap within the company's subreddit 'pool'. Cutting down on redundant and unnecessary subreddits will free massive amounts of space and thus reduce server operation costs and strain on the functionality. The interface will work faster and cost less money to keep up with it. Clientele will be happier with a faster and more responsive program interface. In specific models classified above I have successfully iterated and refined a near perfect predictive accuracy for determining similarity of subreddit posts based on text. Lastly, since there will be less overlap in similar subreddits, new clientele will find it easier to navigate and engage with Reddits mission statement.

This data science team has experience and the energy to see this project through to the final stages of success. There is no better time than the present to educate and potentially prevent future detriment to the populous and enviroment. With the growing state of California on a local and global scale the clock is ticking and we have not only identified the issues but put together a comprehensive plan to visualize and execute a preventitive and insightful plan for medical and government agencies.

Let's make it happen and leave no doubt that the beautiful beaches, mountains, and valleys stay pure and continue to bring joy not health issues to our wonderful citizens. We have the chance to change and impact future generations and policy makers accross the globe.
